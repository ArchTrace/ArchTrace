## 📦 Installation

### Windows

#### Option 1: MSI Installer (Recommended)
1. Download `ArchTrace_X.Y.Z_x64_en-US.msi`
2. Double-click the file
3. **Windows will show a warning "Unknown publisher"** → This is normal, the app is not signed with a commercial certificate
4. Click **"More info"** then **"Run anyway"**
5. Follow the installation wizard

#### Option 2: NSIS Installer
1. Download `ArchTrace_X.Y.Z_x64-setup.exe`
2. Same process as Option 1

**Note**: Windows SmartScreen may block the installation because the app doesn't have a commercial code signing certificate. This is normal for applications without expensive commercial certificates ($300+/year).

### macOS

#### ⚠️ Important - First Installation
macOS will block the app because it's not notarized by Apple.

1. Download `ArchTrace_X.Y.Z_universal.dmg`
2. Open the DMG and drag ArchTrace to Applications
3. **On first launch**, macOS will say "Cannot be opened"
4. Go to **System Preferences** > **Privacy & Security**
5. In the "Security" section, click **"Open Anyway"**
6. ArchTrace will open and work normally after this

**Quick alternative** (command line):
```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/ArchTrace.app
```

### Linux

#### AppImage (Universal)
```bash
# Download
wget https://github.com/ArchTrace/ArchTrace/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/archtrace_X.Y.Z_amd64.AppImage

# Make executable
chmod +x archtrace_X.Y.Z_amd64.AppImage

# Run
./archtrace_X.Y.Z_amd64.AppImage
```

#### Debian/Ubuntu (.deb)
```bash
wget https://github.com/ArchTrace/ArchTrace/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/archtrace_X.Y.Z_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i archtrace_X.Y.Z_amd64.deb
```

#### RPM (Fedora, RHEL, etc.)
```bash
wget https://github.com/ArchTrace/ArchTrace/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/archtrace-X.Y.Z-1.x86_64.rpm
sudo rpm -i archtrace-X.Y.Z-1.x86_64.rpm
```

## 🔄 Automatic Updates

ArchTrace automatically checks for updates on startup and every 6 hours. When an update is available, you'll see a notification to install it with one click.

Updates are **cryptographically signed** to ensure their authenticity.

---

## 🔒 Security

#### Why do Windows/macOS show warnings?

These systems show warnings for apps not signed with commercial certificates (cost: ~$300/year). **This doesn't mean the app is dangerous.**

#### How to verify it's safe?

1. ✅ **Checksums**: Verify checksums provided in releases
2. ✅ **Signed updates**: Auto-updater uses cryptographic signatures
3. ✅ **Consistent source**: Only download from official GitHub releases
4. ✅ **Issue tracking**: Report problems on GitHub for transparency
